# Blockchain-Based Fan Polls for Tamper-Proof Voting

This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof fan polling system. It addresses the real-world problem of unreliable or manipulated voting systems in fan-driven events, such as music awards, sports fan votes, or entertainment contests, by ensuring votes are secure, verifiable, and immutable.

## ✨ Features

- 🗳️ Create polls with customizable options
- 🔒 Secure, anonymous voting using blockchain identities
- ⏰ Time-bound voting periods with automatic closure
- 📊 Transparent vote counting and result verification
- 🛡️ Prevent double voting or unauthorized access
- 💰 Optional staking mechanism for premium polls
